## 🧩 Code Overview

The calculator is built using **Python functions** for modular design:
- `Add(z, y)` → returns the sum of two numbers  
- `subs(z, y)` → returns the difference  
- `multiple(z, y)` → returns the product  
- `devide(z, y)` → safely divides and handles division by zero  
- `FCalculator()` → main function that runs the user interface
